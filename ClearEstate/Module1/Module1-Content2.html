			<h2>Assess</h2>
			<p> One of the first steps you will need to complete is checking to see if there is a <button class="rounded py-1 px-2" id="number1" style="border: 2px solid; border-color: #4057FF; background-color: #fff;"><span style="color: #4057FF; background: #FFFFFF;"> will</span></button> available. Once you have determined this you can move into <button class="rounded py-1 px-2" id="number2" style="border: 2px solid; border-color: #4057FF; background-color: #fff;"><span style="color: #4057FF; background: #FFFFFF;">Probate.</span></button> The steps will be slightly different depending on if there is a will available or not. </p>

			 <h2> Probates </h2>
			
			 <h3> Probate With a Will : Testate&nbsp;</h3>
			 <p> When a person dies with a valid will (“testate”), Deceased’s estate will be distributed according to the terms of their will. In most cases, in order to do so, probate must first be granted. Probate is when a will is validated by the court.  A probate is required to transfer certain types of assets such as real property and bank or investment accounts above a certain threshold. </p>

				</div>
			 <h3> Probate Without a Will: Intestate </h3>
			 <p>When there is no will, someone needs to be appointed by the court to administer the estate, then called the personal representative. Anyone in the jurisdiction of domicile can apply but the court will usually follow the same rules for entitlement based on degree of relationship to the deceased, i.e., spouse, then child then.  As long as anyone with a prior right (high in the order) agrees in writing, someone lower in the order can be appointed. If there is no one to apply, the Public Guardian & Trustee, or applicable local governing body may become involved. This process varies by jurisdiction, however, the average uncontested probate takes between 1 to 6 months once the application has been filed. </p>

				 statutes is to distribute the decedent's property in an organized and methodical way. Each jurisdiction has their own laws that determine how the property will be distributed.</p>

		  <h3> Exploring Testates vs Intestates</h3>
		  <div class="row"> 
			  <div class="col-6"> 
				  <h3>With a will:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a person dies with a valid will (&ldquo;testate&rdquo;), the Deceased&rsquo;s estate will be distributed according to the terms of their will.</li>
<li>The will sets out the testator&rsquo;s wishes including who they want to administer their estate (&lsquo;executor&rsquo;), who their beneficiaries are and what each will receive</li>
<li>It should also include legal powers to facilitate the administration and it can often include funeral and/or burial wishes</li>
</ul>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-6"> 
				  <h3>Without a Will:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When someone dies without a will (&ldquo;intestate&rdquo;), the Court will distribute the estate among the heirs of the deceased, according to intestacy laws of the jurisdiction in which they were domiciled.</li>
<li>When there is no will, someone needs to be appointed by the court to administer the estate, then called the personal representative. Anyone in the jurisdiction of domicile can apply but the court will usually follow the same rules for entitlement based on the degree of relationship to the deceased, i.e., spouse, then child, then grandparents, then siblings</li>
<li>As long as anyone with a prior right (high in the order) agrees in writing, someone lower in the order can be appointed.</li>

	<h3> Non-Probate Assets</h3>
<p>Some of Decedent's assets may be titled in such a way that the assets are transferred by operation of law to the designated beneficiaries, or to the joint owner, upon Decedent&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In those cases, additional paperwork will be necessary to complete the transfer, but not a full probate proceeding.</p>
